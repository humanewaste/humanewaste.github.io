#### The Dismal and Uncomfortable Science

The presentation "The Dismal and Uncomfortable Science of Effective Work and Self-sabotage from the Lense of a Business Anthropologist" brings together observations on organizational dynamics from a variety of far-more-experienced practitioners of productivity and survivors of corporate negligence. An essay intended to accompany the presentation follows.

#### The Scarcity Handicap

In this spanning collection of concepts and case studies the author argues that the narrative of scarcity is an archaic construct peddled by some economists in the interest of social conservatism to the detriment of productive efficacy in the modern world. Expanding upon scarcity as a maladaptive organizing principle, the author explores psychological and sociological considerations of innovation and case studies in mismanagement through scarcity thinking, ultimately suggesting an alternate narrative: abundance.

Individuals in society are handicap by structures of thought that chip away at the inherent motivation people have to lead productive and healthy lives. Debt and scarcity have become twisted in dialogs, with the presumption that scarcity must exist for society to function, regardless of actual material availability; debt has become a burden instead of acting binding agent between communities. Resource managers misuse predictors and further corrupt social and capital systems, ignoring the complexity of systems thinking. We can use the following keywords to develop a dialog about the harmful narratives that have captured our culture, and direct our decision-makers back to a more progressive of a more prosperous and healthy society.

#### Predictors

Observations used in decision-making

Predictions of long term events are often based on systematic biases and cognitive illusions.

Overwhelming evidence shows that professionals from law, medicine and economics employ substandard decision-making processes. Whether based on expert judgement or statistical indicators, without a transparent and determined attention to critical theory, these predictors fail to deliver on their promises

#### Integrated Social Sciences

Integrated social sciences (ISS) brings empirical studies of individuals and groups, gathered from the  interactions from a particular time and place, into a framework of description and analysis . Where limitations of research in physical sciences may be moved by technological improvements in instrumentation, the reproduction of physical interactions, such as in a game of billiards, is simply infeasible when working with the the unique state of individuals and groups, those complex adaptive systems known as “human beings”.
