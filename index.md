#### The Dismal and Uncomfortable Science

The presentation "The Dismal and Uncomfortable Science of Effective Work and Self-sabotage from the Lense of a Business Anthropologist" brings together observations on organizational dynamics from a variety of far-more-experienced practitioners of productivity and survivors of corporate negligence. An essay intended to accompany the presentation follows.

#### The Scarcity Handicap

In this spanning collection of concepts and case studies the author argues that the narrative of scarcity is an archaic construct peddled by some economists in the interest of social conservatism to the detriment of productive efficacy in the modern world. Expanding upon scarcity as a maladaptive organizing principle, the author explores psychological and sociological considerations of innovation and case studies in mismanagement through scarcity thinking, ultimately suggesting an alternate narrative: abundance.

### Keywords

Individuals in society are handicap by structures of thought that chip away at the inherent motivation people have to lead productive and healthy lives. Debt and scarcity have become twisted in dialogs, with the presumption that scarcity must exist for society to function, regardless of actual material availability; debt has become a burden instead of acting binding agent between communities. Resource managers misuse predictors and further corrupt social and capital systems, ignoring the complexity of systems thinking. We can use the following keywords to develop a dialog about the harmful narratives that have captured our culture, and direct our decision-makers back to a more progressive of a more prosperous and healthy society.

#### Predictors
##### Observations used in decision-making
> Long term predictions are influenced by systematic biases and cognitive illusions.

Overwhelming evidence shows that professionals from law, medicine and economics employ substandard decision-making processes. Whether based on expert judgement or statistical indicators, without a transparent and determined attention to critical theory, these predictors fail to deliver on their promises

#### Scarcity
##### Statements about the availability of resources
> Perceived scarcity may lead to poor decisions about resource usage.

American resource management is largely built on the concept of scarcity. As technology has vastly improved production, the world is more frequently experiencing scarcities created through the artificial means, instead of enjoying and engaging in a world of abundance.

#### Handicap
##### Techniques for reducing efficacy
> Handicap occurs when there is little support or sympathy in the private or public sector.

Where the word “handicap” has been used to describe people who have physical or cognitive disabilities, it has meant relief and assistance with resources pooled from the broader population. Those who do not fit into standard, by disability, poverty or economic strains, are handicap. Organizations self-sabotage through requiring standardized behaviors, optimizing for the majority of the population while losing the opportunity of diversity and innovation.

#### Debt
##### Commitments to future interaction
> People may tend to destructive behavior when social ties are overburdened.

Often considered as a bad condition, debt has a long history in human societies as an artifact of binding community members and encouraging further interactions or may break them apart when exploited.

### Learning Programs

#### Integrated Social Sciences

Integrated social sciences (ISS) brings empirical studies of individuals and groups, gathered from the  interactions from a particular time and place, into a framework of description and analysis . Where limitations of research in physical sciences may be moved by technological improvements in instrumentation, the reproduction of physical interactions, such as in a game of billiards, is simply infeasible when working with the the unique state of individuals and groups, those complex adaptive systems known as “human beings”.

#### Business and Adaption

Harvard Business School released a Credential of Readiness (CORe) program covering accounting, economics and statistics (business analysis) to rather positive reviews from the business community. Additional courses are available for those who engage the curriculum and a proctored exam (I did quite poorly on accounting; you're welcome). These courses include deep dives on Innovation, Management and Finance.

The Project Management Institute offers three proctored exams and chapters offer ensemble courses for the primary certificate, the Professional Project Manager. These require self-certification of hours of practice (in practice, years in the field) in various competencies from project coordination, business analysis and adaptive organization.
